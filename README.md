This is an implementation of Raffle It! in Vue, vuex and vue-router, bootstrapped with vue-cli.

## Pros and Cons (Purely Subjective)

Creating this app feels like, as someone else said, using a mix of Angular and React. It's actually quite OK.

Pros | Cons
---- | --------
A good CLI | Mutation, too much mutation
Opiniated 'ecosystem' makes it easy to start | Tooling made hard with a .vue-file, what's wrong with JavaScript-classes?
